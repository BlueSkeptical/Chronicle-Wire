A question mark and space (“? ”) indicate a complex mapping key. Within a block collection, key: value pairs can start immediately following the dash, colon, or question mark.

Example 2.11. Mapping between Sequences

? - Detroit Tigers
  - Chicago cubs
:
  - 2001-07-23

? [ New York Yankees,
    Atlanta Braves ]
: [ 2001-07-02, 2001-08-12,
    2001-08-14 ]

Example 2.12. Compact Nested Mapping

- item    : Basketball
  quantity: 4
- item    : Big Shoes
  quantity: 1


2.3. Scalars

Scalar content can be written in block notation, using a literal style (indicated by “|”) where all line breaks are significant. Alternatively, they can be written with the folded style (denoted by “>”) where each line break is folded to a space unless it ends an empty or a more-indented line.

Example 2.13.  In literals,
newlines are preserved

# ASCII Art
--- |
  \//||\/||
  // ||  ||__

Example 2.14.  In the folded scalars,
newlines become spaces

--- >
  Mark McGwire's
  year was crippled
  by a knee injury.

Example 2.15.  Folded newlines are preserved
for "more indented" and blank lines

>
 Sammy Sosa completed another
 fine season with great stats.

   63 Home Runs
   0.288 Batting Average

 What a year!

Example 2.16.  Indentation determines scope


name: Mark McGwire
accomplishment: >
  Mark set a major league
  home run record in 1998.
stats: |
  65 Home Runs
  0.278 Batting Average


YAML’s flow scalars include the plain style (most examples thus far) and two quoted styles. The double-quoted style provides escape sequences. The single-quoted style is useful when escaping is not needed. All flow scalars can span multiple lines; line breaks are always folded.

Example 2.17. Quoted Scalars

unicode: "Sosa did fine.\u263A"
control: "\b1998\t1999\t2000\n"
hex esc: "\x0d\x0a is \r\n"

single: '"Howdy!" he cried.'
quoted: ' # Not a ''comment''.'
tie-fighter: '|\-*-/|'

Example 2.18. Multi-line Flow Scalars

plain:
  This unquoted scalar
  spans many lines.

quoted: "So does this
  quoted scalar.\n"


2.4. Tags

In YAML, untagged nodes are given a type depending on the application. The examples in this specification generally use the seq, map and str types from the fail safe schema. A few examples also use the int, float, and null types from the JSON schema. The repository includes additional types such as binary, omap, set and others.

Example 2.19. Integers

canonical: 12345
decimal: +12345
octal: 0o14
hexadecimal: 0xC


Example 2.20. Floating Point

canonical: 1.23015e+3
exponential: 12.3015e+02
fixed: 1230.15
negative infinity: -.inf
not a number: .NaN

Example 2.21. Miscellaneous

null:
booleans: [ true, false ]
string: '012345'

Example 2.22. Timestamps

canonical: 2001-12-15T02:59:43.1Z
iso8601: 2001-12-14t21:59:43.10-05:00
spaced: 2001-12-14 21:59:43.10 -5
date: 2002-12-14

Explicit typing is denoted with a tag using the exclamation point (“!”) symbol. Global tags are URIs and may be specified in a tag shorthand notation using a handle. Application-specific local tags may also be used.

Example 2.23. Various Explicit Tags

---
not-date: !!str 2002-04-28

picture: !!binary |
 R0lGODlhDAAMAIQAAP//9/X
 17unp5WZmZgAAAOfn515eXv
 Pz7Y6OjuDg4J+fn5OTk6enp
 56enmleECcgggoBADs=

application specific tag: !something |
 The semantics of the tag
 above may be different for
 different documents.


Example 2.24. Global Tags

%TAG ! tag:clarkevans.com,2002:
--- !shape
  # Use the ! handle for presenting
  # tag:clarkevans.com,2002:circle
- !circle
  center: &ORIGIN {x: 73, y: 129}
  radius: 7
- !line
  start: *ORIGIN
  finish: { x: 89, y: 102 }
- !label
  start: *ORIGIN
  color: 0xFFEEBB
  text: Pretty vector drawing.

Example 2.25. Unordered Sets

# Sets are represented as a
# Mapping where each key is
# associated with a null value
--- !!set
? Mark McGwire
? Sammy Sosa
? Ken Griff

Example 2.26. Ordered Mappings

# Ordered maps are represented as
# A sequence of mappings, with
# each mapping having one key
--- !!omap
- Mark McGwire: 65
- Sammy Sosa: 63
- Ken Griffy: 58
